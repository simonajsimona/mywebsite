abstract: Maternal health care utilization still remains crucial in ensuring good pregnancy outcomes and a reduction in maternal and child mortality especially in developing countries. Although several studies have been conducted to investigate determinants of maternal health care utilization, gender relations in cross-national context has received little attention. This paper sets out to examine the relationship between gender relations and maternal healthcare utilization in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis pools sample data of 245,955 respondents from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and World Development Indicators of 35 sub- Saharan African countries. Separate Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models are fitted for adequate antenatal care and institutional delivery in relation to several factors indicating gender relations at three levels. Fixed and random effects were produced. In addition to several individual-level factors, living in communities with high proportion of female-headed households and those with high proportions of women with decision-making authority increases the odds of maternal healthcare utilization. The results also show that variations in institutional delivery care are mostly attributed to community and country-level factors compared to individual- level characteristics. These results help to underscore the importance of contextual factors in understanding womenâ€™s utilization of maternal healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa
