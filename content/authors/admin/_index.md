I am a lecturer of and research expert at the University of Zambia. I am interested in studying structural sources of disparities in social and health outcomes. I also study how emergence properties develop from micro-level actions and interactions within social systems. My areas of substantive applications include structural violence, global health, mental health gender relations, maternal health care among others 

I have also developed a passion for teaching research methods and software for data analysis to beginners. I have taught several courses and workshops in the United Kingdom and Africa. I mainly use R statistical programming, Stata, IBM SPSS, LaTeX, R Markdown and SQL among others
